# Odin-Recipes
Hello, Today is June 11 at 11:17PM Today's assignment is "Odin-Recipes. The main bullet points being covered are how to properly structre a HTML page, create list, and get use to use GIT. 
I am structuring this commit by reviewing the current assignment, giving my expectations before hand. I will follow up during any meaningful change that happens when completing this assignment and give my final thoughts before I push to GitHub.
I feel pretty comfortable with the HTML portion of this assignment, we will see if everything is completed successfully. Still getting use to using both Git and GitHub. 
11:43 Moving through everything pretty well, but getting stuck on resizing my images. 
11:54 Figured out the images problem. In general not difficult but I definitely move slow. Finished with the first reciepe and need to do other two. Heading to bed due to the time and will complete in the AM. 
Started back at 8:07AM
Finished and pushing to GitHub 8:31AM. Project was concise and easy to follow. Also feeling more confident with commit
June 25th todays lesson is to add CSS to this file
